What you need
We use Python 3.6. Pytorch1.4. Make sure that you have a working implementation of PyTorch installed, to do this see: https://pytorch.org/ To visualise progress we use tensorboardX which can be installed using pip:

pip install tensorboardX tensorboard
No installation is necessary, you can simply run the python code straight from this directory.
